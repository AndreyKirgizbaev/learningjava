content.about1=web application designed to learn the Java programming language. It provides \
  convenient environment for studying. \
  The developed site gives the user the opportunity to interactively learn the language \
  through passing levels: links to topics that are considered within levels are available in the “Levels” section.\
  Information is also available on topics and keywords through an alphabetical index.
content.about2=The web application has a mandatory registration for users. \
  Without registration, access to the course is closed. \
  In addition, the site can change the interface language (Russian, English).
content.about3=Learning a language occurs in levels. Inside the level, several topics are addressed. \
  The transition to the next topic is possible only at the completion of the previous one - \
  the same applies to the transition between levels.
content.about4=The topic consists of both a theoretical component and a practical one: \
  in addition to the text with the theory, \
  the user is given the opportunity to consolidate and verify the knowledge just acquired with \
  by completing a small assignment, “test”. Passing the “test” is necessary to move on to the next topic. \
  As a "test" can be either a test or a solution to the problem. \
  Tasks are presented in the form of independent code writing and subsequent \
  verification by the system at the user's request.
content.about5=Commenting is available inside topics, that is, each user can leave a response, ask a question, \
  discuss the topic with other users.

#Java
java.introMsg=Java programming language
java.about1=Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems \
  since 1991 and officially released on May 23, 1995. Initially, the new programming language was called Oak \
  (James Gosling) and was developed for consumer electronics, but was later renamed to Java and became \
  used to write applets, applications, and server software.
java.about2=Java programs are translated into bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). \
  JVM is a program that processes byte code and passes instructions to equipment as an interpreter. \
  The advantage of such an implementation is the independence of the bytecode from the operating system and hardware, \
  which allows you to run Java applications on any device for which the JVM exists.
java.about3=Another important feature of Java technology is its flexible security system, thanks to\
  that program execution is fully controlled by the virtual machine. \
  Any operations that exceed the established program privileges \
  (for example, attempting unauthorized access to data or connecting to another computer) \
  cause an immediate interruption.
java.about4=Java is a fairly universal programming language, \
  which is often used for web development and for Android development.
java.introMsg2=Java development
java.about5=To work with Java, you need JDK - a set of software, \
  containing the compiler (javac), runtime environment (Java Runtime Environment), \
  standard language library, examples and documentation.
java.about6=You will also need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - \
  it is a software package used by programmers to develop software. \
  The IDE makes it easy to write, run, debug, and test code.
java.about7=You can choose any IDE, but I recommend you use IntelliJ IDEA

books.introMsg=Books
books.newbie=For newbies
books.newbie.book1=Charles Petzold, "Code. The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"
books.newbie.about1=A great book for those who have long forgotten the school course in computer science, \
  or never owned it at all. \
  Important things about the operation of the computer and code are literally explained on the fingers. \
  How, for example, does a computer execute code written by a programmer? \
  And how does he understand from the text of the code what they want from him?
books.newbie.book2=Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates, "Head First Java"
books.newbie.about2=By far the best Java book for beginners! \
  Head-First is a series of many dozens of books in various programming languages. \
  The authors adhere to their own original manner of presenting material, \
  making the book read quickly and very easily. And you can write code and solve problems right in the book!
books.newbie.book3=Herbert Schildt: "Java The Complete Reference"
books.newbie.about3=This book is also good for beginners. \
  It differs from the previous one primarily in the manner of presentation of the material: here it is more strict and consistent \
  (many people prefer this form of presentation of the game material). \
  К её несомненным плюсам можно отнести "разжевывание" материала до самых мелочей, иногда — многократно.
books.mid=Для программистов среднего уровня
books.mid.book1=Брюс Эккель, "Философия Java"
books.mid.about1=Строгая и последовательная подача материала\
  (многие предпочитают именно такую форму подачи материала игровой). \
  Its undoubted advantages include the “chewing” of the material to the smallest detail, sometimes many times.
books.mid.book2=Joshua Bloch, "Effective Java"
books.mid.about2=The author of the book, Joshua Bloch, is one of the developers of the standard Java library. \
  Describes various aspects of the Java language and standard library. \
  About what language constructs can be applied, and how best not to apply; \
  what library classes can be used for what tasks, \
  which ones to use with caution and which not to use at all - everything in this book. \
  It is divided into fairly small chapters. The latter, in turn, are combined into small groups. \
  In this case, the chapters can be read in random order.
books.high=For those who want to become a Java follower
books.high.book1=Tate Bruce, "Bitter Java"
books.high.about1=The book describes design antipatterns, situations in which they may arise, \
  and ways to fix the "bitter" code. Posted by Bruce Tate, \
  has been consulting in the development of enterprise applications for a long time, \
  and of these design anti-patterns.
books.high.book2=Benjamin J. Evans, Martijn Verburg, "The Well-Grounded Java Developer"
books.high.about2=Contains a lot of information about Java and the JVM ecosystem as a whole. \
  What's interesting in Java 7. NIO from 1.4 versus NIO2 from 1.7. Asynchronous channels.\
  Loading, linking, class verification. Bytecode, javap tool, opcodes. \
  How invokedynamic and MethodHandle work and why. \
  What is optimization, what and how to measure. Access to memory and processor caches. \
  Garbage collection. Flags of a virtual machine. Escape analysis, optimization and deoptimization.
